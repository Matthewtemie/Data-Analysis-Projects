# Analytical Report: Predicting Loan Application Outcomes using E-Signed Credit Facility Process & Ticket Performance

This analytical report aims to analyze the status of loan applicants and their loan applications in order to automate the lending process using a machine learning model. The objective is to predict the outcome of the lending process if the credit facility process was completed through e-process, specifically E-Signed or not. The main focus of this case study was to identify applicants who have completed the e-process through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques.

## 1. Introduction
The lending process is a crucial part of financial institutions, and automating this process can lead to increased efficiency and reduced operational costs. In this case study, we analyzed the data related to loan applicants and their loan applications to determine if the credit facility process completed via e-process (E-Signed) or not. By building a machine learning model, we were able to predict the outcome of the lending process for applicants who have completed the e-process.

## 2. Data Collection
The first step in our analysis was to gather relevant data. The dataset used for this case study consists of information about loan applicants, including their personal details, financial information, and the outcome of their loan applications. The data was collected from the lending institution's database and may include both historical and current data.

## 3. Data Preprocessing
Before performing any analysis, it was essential to preprocess the data to ensure its quality and suitability for modeling. This step involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, addressing outliers, and transforming variables if necessary. Additionally, data cleaning techniques such as data type conversions and standardization were applied to facilitate further analysis.

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis is a crucial step in understanding the dataset and extracting valuable insights. During this phase, we  examined the relationships between different variables, identify patterns, and visualize the data using various statistical and graphical techniques. EDA techniques employed included summary statistics, data visualization, correlation analysis, and hypothesis testing.

## 5. Feature Engineering
Feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the predictive power of the machine learning model. In this case study, we identified relevant features that can potentially impact the outcome of the lending process. This included deriving new variables from the existing dataset, such as calculating debt-to-income ratio or creating categorical variables based on specific criteria.

## 6. Model Development
Once the data was prepared and relevant features are engineered, we proceeded with building a machine learning model to predict the outcome of the lending process. The choice of the model will depend on the nature of the problem and the characteristics of the dataset. Potential models that can be used include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting algorithms. We trained the model using the historical data and evaluate its performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.

## 7. Model Evaluation
After training the model, we assessed its performance using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model was be tested on a separate dataset to measure its generalization capabilities. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation or stratified sampling may be employed to ensure the reliability and robustness of the model. The results will be interpreted and discussed in the context of the lending process automation.

## 8. Conclusion
In the final section of the report, we summarized the key findings and conclusions drawn from the analysis. We discussed the predictive power of the machine learning model and its potential implicationsfor automating the lending process. We will highlight the significance of e-process completion (E-Signed) in determining the outcome of loan applications and how it can contribute to streamlining the credit facility process.

Furthermore, we will discuss the limitations of the study, including any data constraints, assumptions made during the analysis, and potential areas for further research or improvement. Suggestions for implementing the developed machine learning model into the existing lending system will be provided, along with considerations for data privacy and security.



Overall, this analytical report aims to provide insights into the status of loan applicants and their loan applications, with a specific focus on automating the lending process through the use of machine learning. By predicting the outcome of the lending process based on the completion of the e-process, financial institutions can optimize their operations, reduce manual effort, and improve the overall efficiency of the credit facility process.
